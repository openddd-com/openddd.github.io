description:

Based on the design and general concept behind the website of [Architekten
Ronacher :ref](../architekten-ronacher/) a second project was created for a
vacation rental website.  It uses Lektor to present itself, the apartments and
the area surrounding it.

Because this is for a rental it also embeds external services like Google
Maps and a booking engine.
